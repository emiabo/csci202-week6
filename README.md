# CSCI 202 Assignment 6
## Concept
> Digital Zine - Working individually or in a small group create a digital zine about [one of the recorded talks form the Internet Studies lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6XTvy4F9kpQwd6nRvo2Otg). Listen to their talk closely, and then use your digital zine to respond, interpret, or showcase their argument or ideas.

- Look through the lecture series

> Keep exploring that idea - Your passion is calling. You're excited about a specific idea. It could take the form of a zine, a game, a dynamic map of fires in the PNW, you tell me... the sky  is the limit, or should I say low earth orbit. 

- *2M* - Game about staying in your personal space. Had this idea since before I took the class. Maybe p5 spanning the whole page, with popover website explaining the concept and additional writings.
- Flesh out Project 4 - Daily Grind to my original concept
